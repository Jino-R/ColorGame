A coluor game made from Colt Steele's web development bootcamp on Udemy, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game provides a colour in RGB form, the user then has to guess the correct coluor from 6 different colours on hard mode or 3 different colours on easy mode. The user can switch between hard or easy mode. The colours are generated at random. If the user guesses incorrectly the colour square that was picked fades away and the user can guess again. If the user guesses correctly then all the colours turn into the correct colour.
